This project aims to explore the use of Streamlit in conjunction with APIs for Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically utilizing DeepSeek. The goal is to develop an interactive web application that allows users to interact with an AI chatbot, generating responses in real-time.

Features
Interactive Chatbot: A chatbot that answers questions on various subjects, using DeepSeek to generate the responses.

Interface for DeepSeek APIs: Allows users to interact with DeepSeek's APIs, sending prompts and viewing the responses instantly.

Code Explanation Assistant: An application that uses LLMs to explain code snippets in various languages, integrating models from Hugging Face with Streamlit.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implementation of a RAG chatbot using DeepSeek-R1, Chroma (for context retrieval), and Gradio (for the user interface).
